# Project requires Node 16.10.0

- I used `nvm -use 16.10.0` to specify version

after cloning, run:

### `yarn start`


### TODOS:

- Lots of code could be broken down into smaller components, (showToast, axiosCall, searcbButton).
- Tests should be added to test html listeners, and mock data responses form the API to test with internal component functions.
- Pagination is important and definitely something i would want to implement, managing 400 requests on one page is a little hectic.
