# Project requires Node 16.10.0

- I used `nvm -use 16.10.0` to specify version

after cloning, run:

### `yarn start`


### TODOS:

- Lots of code could be broken down into smaller components, (showToast, axiosCall, searchButton).
- Tests should be added to test html listeners, and mock data responses form the API to test with internal component functions.
- Pagination is important and definitely something i would want to implement, managing 400 requests on one page is a little hectic.
- State should be brought in from useContext
- frontend backend could utilize a better data/network layer by abstracting it out of project and use a rest based service.
- Typescript could be improved on alot, replacing any casts, and have models that conform to all data types
